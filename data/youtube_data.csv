Y6Yv01aPHz8,Darshil Parmar,Best Programming Language To Learn In 2022,"Java vs Scala vs Python For Data Engineering! Which one is better and which one you should learn to get more opportunities? 

Data Engineers are one of the most sought-after professionals in the IT industry today. There are a number of reasons for this. 

First and foremost, the demand for data-driven software solutions is on the rise. 
Second, most companies need a strong team of data engineers to handle the increasing influx of data in their systems. 

The data engineer is a hybrid role that combines the skills of a software developer, a data scientist, and a database administrator. 

Data engineers are responsible for the entire lifecycle of any data-driven project. They have to collect, process, store and use data for business intelligence purposes.

In this video, I have discussed one of the most asked questions related to data engineering 
Which programming language is best for Data Engineering!

aeQy9XXOEHA,Darshil Parmar,Top Data Engineering Skills To Learn In 2022,"Data engineering is a fast-growing field in the data analysis industry, which is why so many professionals are on the hunt for new data engineering tools to learn in 2022. 

Data engineering is also considered to be a subset of the broader field of data science. Data engineers are experts in data analytics and data warehousing, and they specialize in collecting, storing, and analyzing data. 

Data engineering requires dealing with huge volumes of data, and it is a highly specialized field. It is not just data collection, data access, data processing, and data storage that data engineers deal with. 

They also handle the whole process of data management, data governance, and data quality, in addition to data analytics. 

Data engineering is an ever-evolving field, and it will be even more important in the future, as the amount of data being generated grows every day.

Shashank Mishra (E-Learning Bridge) has worked on many big companies such as McKinsey Consulting, PayTm, Amazon. 

He started his career as a software developer and then shifted his career to data engineer. 

The best part is he did not study from a top-tier college or a high level of competitive coding but he was still managed to get a job in these big companies.

He even got rejected by both of these companies but he did not give up and kept going!

4P37f9OfH_A,Darshil Parmar,Optimising Redshift DataWarehouse using DIST and SORT Key,"In this video, we go over the concept of DISTKEY and SORTKEY. If you're a MySQL or PostgreSQL user who is used to indexes, these two Redshift concepts might seem a bit strange. 

Redshift's DISTKEY and SORTKEY are powerful tools that are easy to use. By using these options, you can avoid issues that can be caused by Redshift's compression. Such issues include slow queries, wrong results, missing results, and more.

In fact, the way Redshift uses them, you'll probably never have a need for a fully-fledged index. Indexes are great, but they have a cost, so it's important to understand when indexes are appropriate for your workload. 

In this video, we go over the basics of DISTKEY and SORTKEY by looking at a basic example.

Both are very important to computer science. 

To be a good engineer, you have to know various data structures and algorithms. You don't have to remember everything, but knowing the names of different data structures and the problems they solve will surely help you in your interviews. 

They are important to know, but it is also important to understand why they are important.

SSlOklihflY,Seattle Data Guy,What Types Of Projects Should Data Teams Work On?,"Joe Reis recently wrote a piece titled, Playing Not To Lose. The piece referenced the fact that many data teams are simply going through the motions and doing ""data stuff"" as he put it.

Gordon Wong later tagged in and referenced the point of being defensive vs offensive in terms of what work you take on.

This made me want to dig even deeper into what Joe Reis meant and how he feels data teams can go on the offensive effectively to take on projects that actually are worth investing in.

Or perhaps are there certain companies that don't benefit as much from data teams?

YST1sWFPDh4,Seattle Data Guy,Extracting Data From APIs As Data Engineers - The Basics And Challenges You'll Run Into,"If you've had to build any data pipelines for analytics, then you're likely very familiar with the extract phase of an ELT or ETL.

As the name suggests the extract phase is when you connect to a data source and ""extract"" data from it. The most common data sources you'll be interacting with being databases, APIs, and file servers(via FTP or SFTP).

With my recent focus on going back to the basics, it occurred to me that I have never written about APIs and how we interact with them as data engineers.

Now, there are plenty of APIs that have caused me a lot of heartburn in my career and there are others that have been a piece of cake to handle.

But it all comes down to how the API is set up and the design choices made when it was built.

If you're looking for an out of the box solution to handle your API data extraction. You can check out the two below:

Portable For APIs - https://portable.io/

Estuary For Real Time Data Extraction -  https://bit.ly/4eQC3oQ

Disclosure - I have a financial stake in both

pQMw1T0s3RA,Seattle Data Guy,From Hackathons to Co-Founding - Analyzing Unstructured Data With SQL,"One of the benefits of working in big tech is you often build or see toolings and solutions internally that could benefit a broader audience. Whether it's a query engine or a data storage format.

Richard Meng has been working as a Staff Software Engineer at companies like Linkedin and Snowflake with data as a particular focus.

Most recently his experiences at Snowflake provided him with several insights into how LLMs can better be used to process data. In particular, unstructured data.

For example, instead of going the standard method of chunking the documents and embedding them into vectors to allow future users to ask questions of said data. Richard's team believes in directly using vision LLM on unstructured data in their raw format, which preserves the original context of said unstructured data as much as possible. 

In this live chat, I'll be focusing on Richard's experiences that led up to this point and how he is viewing LLMs impacting the work of data engineers.

eD-AeRMefiU,Seattle Data Guy,Build A Data Stack That Lasts - How To Ensure Your Data Infrastructure Is Maintainable,"As a consultant, I have been called in to review and, in many cases, replace dozens of half-finished, abandoned, and sometimes forgotten data infrastructure projects.

The data infrastructure in a few cases may just need a little tweaking to operate effectively, but other times the project is either so incomplete or so lacking in a central design that the best thing to do is replace the old system.

Trust me, I’d love it if I could come into a project and simply change a few lines of code, and then everything would just work. However, so many projects are filled with unclear design decisions or resume-driven development that were never rooted in good planning.

Of course, business stakeholders may have also push to get things done quickly. Forcing data teams to take on tech debt that will never be fixed. Don’t get me wrong, you want to get things done and move projects forward. But taking on technical debt is a decision that needs to be made intentionally. Otherwise, like in resume driven development, your data infrastructure might disappear.

This begs the question.

How do you ensure the data infrastructure you’re building doesn’t get replaced as soon as you leave in the future?

In this article I wanted to dive into the problems I often come into that require me to replace the current data infrastructure and how you can avoid it.

So let’s dive in.

uKLscjh__Yc,Seattle Data Guy,What Is Databricks Genie And Should You Use It - Testing Out Databricks Genie,"Databricks is releasing several new features meant to help users both technical and non-technical access data and ask questions of it.

But is it good enough to replace analysts, tableau and our current approach?

In this video Josue Bogran (https://www.linkedin.com/in/josuebogran/) will be walking through an example and I'll let you decide your thoughts.

But here was some of Josue thoughts from a recent post.

AI/BI Dashboards, are they good enough to replace Tableau?

In about 1 year to 1.5 years, yes. Right now, it is suitable for developers, but dashboards are not quite polished yet for CFO/leadership level. Likely 6 months to be polished enough for mid management usage. For now, keeping Tableau, PBI or Sigma is what works.

AI/BI Genie, how impactful is it?
I am a big believer in the value and capabilities it will have as the product matures. To get to that level of maturity, I believe it will be worst case scenario 2 years from now and best case scenario, 1 year. It is the sweet-spot between LLMs and your data, with Genie being similar to an intern that learns more and more about your preferences and how to provide data to you.

n74ke0Wjmi4,Seattle Data Guy,Don't Lead A Data Team Before Watching This - 5 Lessons You Need To Know As A Head of Data,"Recently, I heard 2-to 3 data leaders say that the default state of most data teams is failure. But I don’t think most data teams are set up for success to start with(I also don’t believe that failure is the default state).

I do however, find that many data engineers, analysts, and scientists get thrown into the role of Head of Data or perhaps director and don’t get much in the way of coaching or advice. 

There is just the expectation that we will do a good job because we were a good individual contributor.

So I wanted to start to put together a list of what you need to know and do to be successful as a leader in the data space.

This ranges from taking even more time to understand the business to being intentional on how you hire and place talent.

So if you’re thinking of leading a data team or perhaps already are this is for you!

- What are the main pain points of the customers?
- What does the business flow look like?
- Who is our customer?
- (What other questions would you add)

More than likely, if you're a Head Of Data, you've hopefully got the technical chops to excel in the role. 

But if you don't have a strong understanding of the business, you'll either end up becoming a task taker who struggles to get out of ad-hoc requests or you'll build a bunch of fancy infrastructure that delivers nothing for the business.

6ldUZ4iHxI8,Seattle Data Guy,Apache Spark Vs Apache Flink – Looking Through How Different Companies Approach Spark And Flink,"As data increased in volume, velocity, and variety, so, in turn, did the need for tools that could help process and manage those larger data sets coming at us at ever faster speeds.

As a result, frameworks such as Apache Spark and Apache Flink became popular due to their abilities to handle big data processing in a fast, efficient, and scalable manner.

But we often find that sometimes it can be difficult to understand which use cases are best suited for Spark as well as for Flink (or even which might be suited for both).

In this article, we’ll discuss some of those unique benefits for both Spark and Flink and help you understand the difference between the two, and go over real use cases, including ones where the engineers were trying to decide between Spark vs. Flink.

9CSjgKI363M,Seattle Data Guy,8 Years Of Data Consulting - 9 Of The Best Lessons I Have Learned While Consulting,"One of the first challenges I faced as a new data consultant was writing my first statement of work.

I know, it seems like a simple problem, but honestly when the prospect asked for one, I realized I never really planned this far.

I had spent the past few months marketing and networking, doing whatever I could to try to get prospects to talk to me and now that someone was interested I realized I didn't have a clue what to do.

Suddenly I was Googling SOW templates and looking for some consistency or pattern that could lead me to a clear answer(there really wasn't much). Eventually, I found a few templates I like and have expanded them over the years.

The past near decade of consulting has taught me a lot from marketing, to creating offers and running projects.

I wanted to put together a live where I talk through some of these lessons and have y'all ask questions. Feel free let me know if you have any!

rqLbn1PQPKA,Seattle Data Guy,Data Modeling Where Theory Meets Reality - How Different Companies I Worked At Modeled Their Data,"Data modeling varies at different companies. 

At facebook we had plenty of storage and often treated historical data modeling very differently compared to when I worked at an enterprise.

The concept of slowly changing dimensions wasn't as prevalent and instead we simply stored snapshots of data every day.

So let's talk about modeling historical data and how it varied.

I  have spent my career focused on all forms of data. I have focused on developing algorithms to detect fraud, reduce patient readmission and redesign insurance provider policy to help reduce the overall cost of healthcare. I have also helped develop analytics for marketing and IT operations in order to optimize limited resources such as employees and budget. I privately consult on data science and engineering problems both solo as well as with a company called Acheron Analytics. I have experience both working hands-on with technical problems as well as helping leadership teams develop strategies to maximize their data.

nhS7KhuNqQU,Seattle Data Guy,The History And Future Of Real-time Analytics - With David Yaffe,"If you’ve worked in data for any period of time, you've either worked on real-time analytics or don't think it exists, depending on your team. 

We hear the term brought up by end-users who may mean “real-time” as in daily or hourly uploads. It could also mean up to the millisecond operationally important workflows that require fine-tuning and perhaps a tool or two to make it easy.

But how have real-time workflows changed over the years and where is it heading? 

In order to discuss this topic I wanted to bring on David from Estuary who has been dealing with real-time problems since the Adtech boom in the 2010s.

He and his team built an open source solution Gazette which helped them outflank the rest of the realtime ad-tech companies. 

Now in 2024, we’ll talk about how real-time has changed and where he sees it going.

David is also the CEO of Estuary.dev, which if you're looking for real-time data ingestion then you should check it out here - https://bit.ly/3Ed1RLe",,1413.0,49.0,0.0,0.0,3395.0,hd,false,Wednesday,2024-03-20,03:02:03
XYZxufvwC14,Seattle Data Guy,Best AWS Services You Need To Know As A Data Engineer - How To Become A Data Engineer,"Cloud service providers such as AWS and GCP offer hundreds of services, and sometimes it can be a little confusing to figure out what solution does what and how data engineers and data scientists might use them.

In this article, I wanted to discuss some of the services that are useful to know as a data engineer as well as provide a combination of real-world examples where I have used said services. I’ll also only be focusing on AWS for now.

So let’s dive into the cloud services you should know as a data engineer.

Bs6UgJccEoI,Seattle Data Guy,Optimizing Your Data Infrastructure - How To Become A Better Data Engineer,"I once had an engineer tell me that they essentially didn’t want to consider cost as they were building a solution. I was baffled. Don’t get me wrong, yes, when you’re building, you iterate and aim to improve your solutions cost.

But from my perspective, I don’t think completely ignoring costs from day one is a good plan.

Cost plays a role in all forms of projects, whether you’re building bridges or writing code. How much budget is allocated to build and maintain a solution is important. In the real world, it can change the materials used, the timeline, or the final product’s design.

In the tech world it also plays a similar role, and it can help you build more optimal systems.

Thanks all for watching.

If you're looking to improve your data infrastructure or reduce your costs, you can set up a free consult below.

wvUiRHd47M0,Seattle Data Guy,How And Why Data Engineers Need To Care About Data Quality Now - And How To Implement It,"As companies look to incorporate AI and ML into their data strategies and roadmaps, there is a new opportunity to refocus on data quality.

Regardless of how fancy or sophisticated a company's AI model might be, poor data quality will make the outputs of these models useless at best, and misleading and company destroying at worst.

So, as your company is rolling out its internally developed LLM or implementing a dynamic pricing model, it’s a great time to review your data quality strategy.

The first key point to cover is that data quality is not limited to one pillar, like accuracy. But instead, several key pillars need to be considered when developing your data quality system.

05qnK0OpOFM,Seattle Data Guy,Dealing With Messy Data Infrastructure And Migrations,"Whether it be due to migration or just the natural entropy of systems, data infrastructure can become messy.

And it might get to the point where no one who originally built the core system is working at the company anymore.

Meaning it can be difficult for new hires and consultants to come in and be productive. 

So how can you be productive in those environments? 

How can you deal with messy legacy systems?

That is what I am going to talk to Phillip Hall about.

gkKY6Q3GApw,Seattle Data Guy,The Realities Of Airflow - The Mistakes New Data Engineers Make Using Apache Airflow,"Airflow remains a popular choice when it comes to open-source orchestration tools.

When I surveyed people about a year ago now, it was the most popular open-source solution, and still to this day, my video on “Should You Use Airflow” drives a lot of prospect conversations.

Now, I do want to say that there are plenty of organizations using Azure Data Factory and Informatica, and there are plenty of competitors knocking on Airflow's door.

But for now, Airflow is like the PHP of the data world; people can talk poorly about it, but it continues to be heavily relied upon.

Now, as I said, Airflow is often why I get brought into many projects, meaning I have seen many different ways that teams decide to deploy Airflow.

Some scaled, others didn’t.

Thus, I wanted to take a moment and discuss some ways I have seen Airflow deployed in the past and the challenges people faced as they deployed their code.

If your team is looking to deploy Airflow, or needs help setting up Airflow, then set up a consultation here - https://calendly.com/ben-rogojan/consultation

Also, if you'd like to learn about an alternative to Airflow, you can check out Mage.ai(https://bit.ly/41h6Pjy)

Then now is a great time to do it. 

It’s the end of the year meaning people are ready to start thinking about 2024!

Whether you’re on the business side or the data side, taking a moment to plan out your data roadmap for 2024 can help shift your data team from a service organization to a strategic one.

There are so many different ways I have seen data teams configured.

Sometimes the data engineering team is centralized while the analysts all work directly with their departments.

Other times the DEs and DAs are in pods that are connected to finance, HR, operations, etc.

But when should companies look to change how they are organizing their teams?

And to which set-up?

These are some of the questions I will be asking Ethan Aaron, CEO of Portable next week.

We can talk about the perfect architecture or tools but those are just meant to make delivering easier.

So even as a data analytics team is building, it's important that they keep iterating and delivering the data and metrics the business needs to make decisions.

That brings up the question.

How do data teams balance delivering and ensuring what they are building is maintainable and flexible?

That way, when the business asks for some new report or needs some data that might not already be ingested, it's easy to get to.

What exactly makes up an effective data team?

I am going to talk to Tom Rampley, A Data Analytics Director with nearly 10 years of experience managing data teams, how to make sure data teams stay effective.

l58yH2aOoJU,Seattle Data Guy,Everyone's Data Infrastructure Is A Mess  - The Truth About Working As A Data Engineer,"Is everyone’s data a mess?

Recently, I came across a post in the data engineering subreddit that asked the question.


The answer is yes, but no.

As someone who has seen data infrastructure at FAANGs, Enterprises, start-ups, and every other company in between, all companies need to make some concessions that can build up and become messy over a long period of time.

So let’s discuss some of the causes of data infrastructure becoming messy and how some companies are trying to deal with it.

Also, I forgot to cover a very important topic!

That is all of the mess often starts at the data source.

But you will face lots of challenges when actually diving into the logic and business processes that are involved to create said data.

The goal of data modeling is to represent the business, its transactions and so forth so that others can utilize the data.

But its far harder than just taking a star schema and slapping it on top of your data.

Which career choice is right for you?

When I first broke into the data world, data science was the place to be.

Everyone wanted to be involved.

But eventually, I slowly found myself being pulled away from data science and instead found data engineering a better career path for me.

So is data engineering a good career choice for you?

hNJCxF3IWC4,Seattle Data Guy,What Is Change Data Capture - Understanding Data Engineering 101,"Companies continue to look for methods to gain near-real-time access to their data for analytics. Honestly, this has been ongoing since I got into the data industry a decade ago…and well before that.

One possible choice is a method called change data capture, also known as CDC. I have seen companies employ multiple ways to use CDC or CDC-like approaches to pull data from databases like Postgres or MongoDB. 

This can range from using triggers to reading logs.

Of course, this focuses on the analytical component as many companies use CDC to replace or supplement traditional ETL/ELT.

But CDC can also be a great way to understand your database and its structure. Databases abstract much of what they do to manage and process large volumes of data quickly. 

Here are a a few articles on CDC if you need to learn more

So let’s dive in.

0DsaafI1fTQ,Seattle Data Guy,Do You REALLY Need A Data Warehouse - What Are The Benefits Of A Data Warehouse?,"Recently several consulting calls started with people asking, “Do we need a data warehouse?”

This isn’t a question about whether you need data warehouse consultants, but instead whether you should event start a data warehouse project. Which is a very fair question. Not every company needs a data warehouse.

That being said data warehouses can provide a lot of benefits.

They help centralize data, provide an easy access layer for data analysts and more. But they aren’t always a worthwhile investment. Our team has helped some companies develop far lighter weight solutions in order to keep costs low.

If your company is trying to answer the question, do you need a data warehouse, then set up a consultation call with me today! 

https://calendly.com/ben-rogojan/consultation

I wrote an article to help answer that question as well here

Data modeling was a popular subject coming out of 2022.

People realized just shoving data into giant blobs comes with a lot of costs.

Bad data

Expensive compute

Confusion

I wanted to talk to someone who has been leading data teams and implementing data models in the real world.

Someone who has migrated from on-prem to in the cloud.

So when I talked to Veronika last year I knew I wanted to have her on a future live.

So come and join us today at 3 PM!

Q4WM1Ca9tKA,Seattle Data Guy,Getting Promoted As An Engineer - How To Go From Junior To Staff,"60% of the respondents to my 2022 State Of Data survey aren’t confident they know what is required to get a promotion. This made me re-examine what I know about leveling and skill expectations.

Seriously, what is expected at different levels?

I have found that tech companies will break down what is expected pretty clearly(even if it’s not always followed to a T ). Different levels are based on the axes they find valuable.

This could be based on axes such as the ones stated by Omar Halabieh (Head of Technology at Amazon Payment Services) which were:

Independence
Complexity
Scope
Ambiguity
Influence
Impact

Facebook also had a similar set of axes including impact, direction, scope, people, and engineering excellence. I would say tech companies are in the minority when it comes to having clear axes and expectations (based on discussions I have had). Most people I have talked to find that their promotions in standard enterprise companies are somewhat attached to project deliverables, years of experience, and the hands of fate.

That aside, for this article, I will be focusing on breaking down the expectations at various levels for scope, influence, impact, complexity, and independence.

So I suggested they look into OLAP. But they weren't sure what that was, so I decided to make a video about databases vs data warehouses vs data lakes.

I  have spent my career focused on all forms of data.

I privately consult on data science and engineering problems both solo as well as with a company called Acheron Analytics.

syN4rGwE0rg,Seattle Data Guy,What Is A Data Catalog And Why Do People Use Them?,"Special Thanks To Atlan For Partnering With Me On This Video. Learn more about them here: https://bit.ly/3VMCCXV

What is a data catalog? 

iData was Facebook’s data discoverability tool. It provided a lot of functionality that I have started to miss. This included the baseline functions you would expect including the ability to find tables, trace lineage, and track down owners of said tables.

But there were also other beneficial features like cost tracking, data quality assessments, and table certification. All of these features made it easy for a new data engineer to quickly orient themselves as they started on new projects.

My Favorite iData Feature
My favorite features involved being able to see how other users were using the data on a query level. This provided a lot more context than just commented fields. ERDs and data lineage are all great. But seeing exactly how other users were using the data made it easy to understand(also they were great people to ping if you had questions).

It was so easy to quickly understand how the data was already being used. This provided several benefits including:

Reducing the duplication of work

Providing context on how data could join together(even across multiple data sources)

It would let you know who to ask questions about the data. Sure, the owner is one great place to start, but sometimes owners, over time, move away from datasets

Upon leaving the company formerly known as Facebook I felt like I kept stumbling on a new data catalog or discoverability tool every week. At this point, I am sure I have come across at least 3-5 dozen data discovery tools all of which add their own flair to helping teams manage their metadata.

goT7gN1lwBI,Seattle Data Guy,Why Are Data Teams Still Struggling To Answer Basic Questions,"“Why do we still struggle to answer basic questions like how many customers are still active or what exactly is the company’s churn?”

This was a question posed to a panel I was sitting on at the Snowflake Summit. Several panelists provided different answers and all come from very different perspectives. Truth be told I have mulled over this question for the last few years as I worked on projects that involved reconciling basic numbers like several active customers or total sales for a company.

Metrics most would assume would be easy to calculate but continue to plague companies even after they spent large amounts of their budget trying to build robust data infrastructure.

Rarely is this due to one cause. Over the years I have seen a multitude of reasons why companies struggle to answer basic questions. These reasons range from constant turnover of developers, ERP and CRM migrations, producers of data constantly changing what data they provide, and mergers and acquisitions(of course there are still more reasons). All in all, trying to continually report even basic numbers can prove to be very challenging when the underlying components are constantly shifting, but let’s discuss some of these issues and how we can try to mitigate them.

Built by Fishtown Analytics (now dbt Labs), the data build tool or dbt allows data analysts, data engineers and analytics engineers to execute the “transform“ step in the Extract-Load-Transform pipeline.

They can do this by writing transforms  in SQL and executes it against its company’s database. 

Dubbed as the “analytics engineering tool,” dbt is also open source and has become a regular part of the modern data stack of many companies. It also has had a solid support community formed around it.

njttWa08pwo,Seattle Data Guy,Why Everyone Cares About Snowflake,"Scrolling through Linkedin, I continue to find other data engineers who echo the same sentiment I have when it comes to cloud data warehouses.

That is to say that Snowflake and Bigquery are dominating the market.

But here is the thing, According to Slintel, Amazon Redshift is still dominating the market with 26.36%( of course it doesn’t take much searching to find completely different numbers and ranking on different sites for the same few products).

So perhaps that point is moot.

What isn’t moot is the underlying current among data professionals who have had a chance up to use Snowflake.

Many seem to enjoy it?

The question is.

Why?

-Gk47wz1DIw,Seattle Data Guy,Is Tom Nash Wrong About Snowflake Vs Palantir - Can Palantir Replace The Modern Data Stack?,"This week I have been digging into Palantir’s tool called Foundry. I have buried myself deep into Stack Overflow questions about Foundry, looked into their AWS integrations, and watched multiple CGI and product demos of how companies could use Foundry as an all-in-one data tool.

Why?
Because I realized that Palantir is trying to take on the entire modern data stack. All in one tool.

Don’t believe me? Just check out some of their marketing materials on the Foundry main page.


They think they have the answer to analytics and the entire data infrastructure stack.

I guess I should stop writing my series on the baseline data stack huh?

But let’s drill into this more before I give up on the last few articles I wrote.

Tools and technology are just that.

🛠️ Tools.

They won’t actually drive any form of impact on their own.

They won’t develop processes that are connected to dashboards that in turn drive actions without people. Nor are the numbers they are creating going to magically jump off the screen and fix a business.

So before building any data pipeline it’s important to consider a few things.

W2L7Q3J-ei0,Seattle Data Guy,SQL Interview Questions For Data Scientists And Data Engineers - Tips For Practicing SQL Interviews,"SQL has become a common skill requirement across industries and job profiles over the last decade.

Companies like Amazon and Google will often demand that their data analysts, data scientists and product managers are at least be familiar with SQL. This is because SQL remains the language of data.
 
So, in order to be data-driven, people need to know how to access and analyze data.

With so many people looking at, slicing, manipulating, and analyzing data we wanted to provide some tips to help improve your SQL.

wuiJWSz-OLQ,Seattle Data Guy,How To Become A GREAT Data Analyst - 5 Skills And Best Practices For Data Analysts,"Data analysis is abstract. It is not math (although math is involved) and it is not English or accounting. It requires a hands-on approach to truly understand the pitfalls good analysts will run into.

Yet, most students have not dealt with vague parameters and large data sets by the time they get their first job, which is a shame! Many students haven’t even heard of a data warehouse and this is where most of the data, which helps managers make critical decisions, resides.

In the modern business world, data analysis is not limited to data scientists. It is also key for analysts, system engineers, financial teams, PR, HR, marketing, and so on.

9vRfTZdbjtM,Seattle Data Guy,They Left A FAANG After Only 4 Months - (Did They Make A Mistake?),"A few days ago a redditor posted on the data engineering subreddit that they quit facebook after only 4 Months

Part of what they said was that:

A lot of the data at Meta is generated in-house, by the products that they've developed. This means that any data generated or collected is made available through the logs, which are then parsed and stored in tables. There are no APIs to connect to, CSVs to ingest, or tools that need to be connected so they can share data. It's just tables. The pipelines that parse the logs have, for the most part, already been built, and thus your job as a DE is to work with the tables that are created every night. I found this incredibly boring because I get more joy/satisfaction out of working with really dirty, raw data. That's where I feel I can add value. But data at Meta is already pretty clean just due to the nature of how it's generated and collected. If your joy/satisfaction comes from helping Data Scientists make the most of the data that's available, then FAANG is definitely for you. But if you get your satisfaction from making unusable data usable, then this likely isn't what you're looking for.

-ClWgwC0Sbw,Seattle Data Guy,What Is The Modern Data Stack - Intro To Data Infrastructure Part 1,"To put things simply, the modern data stack (MDS) is a set of tools that power data integration. In order, these tools include a fully managed data pipeline for “extract, load, and transform” (ELT) processes along with a cloud-based data lake or columnar warehouse for the data’s destination. On top of that, MDS requires a data transformation tool and a visualization or business intelligence (BI) platform so your company can make use of all the numbers.

The primary difference between a modern data stack and a legacy data stack lies in the host. The modern data stack is hosted in the cloud and, as a result, requires very little technical interference from its users. The modern data stack almost guarantees end-user accessibility, while the company at-large enjoys endless scalability that grows quickly without the expensive downtime associated with scaling the server room that supports a legacy data stack.

In 2022, I am seeing more internships and jr. data engineering positions. 

So there is a chance you might be able to find a role out of college...as long as companies don't expect 2 years of experience for a jr. position.

bqCXVpRqTpE,Seattle Data Guy,What I Learned From 100+ Data Engineering Interviews - Interview Tips,"Data engineering interviews are tough.

Interviewing for any technical position generally requires preparing, studying, and long, all-day interviews.

Data engineering interviews, like other technical interviews, require plenty of preparation. There are a number of subjects that need to be covered in order to ensure you are ready for back-to-back questions.

Some positions require Hadoop, others SQL. Some roles require understanding statistics, while still others require heavy amounts of system design.

We have gathered many of the resources that we have used to study and get jobs at companies in the FAANG family as well as other major tech companies. We have yet to find one that requires you to know anything about Hadoop during the interview, so that has not been included in this study guide.

These are two great options when it comes to starting your first Airflow project. They help reduce a lot of issues such as scaling workloads across workers and managing all the other various components required to run Airflow at scale.

Of course, both Cloud Composer and MWAA are services provided by two of the larger cloud providers. But there is a third option called Astronomer.

In this article, I want to discuss some of the benefits and limitations of Cloud Composer and MWAA as well as discuss why Astronomer might be a better fit for many companies.

You fought your way through all the complex interviews and negotiated yourself an amazing salary. Honestly, for your first job ever, it’s way more than you had ever thought you could make.

This is the place where people like Larry Ellison and Reid Hoffman planted their billion-dollar companies and now it is time for you to get your piece!
You landed in SFO an hour ago and you have already seen 4 Waymo cars and overheard a few phone calls with people using words like burn-rate and mentioning 50 million dollar as if it were nothing.

It’s all exciting and a little overwhelming considering you came from a smaller town in middle America where things were a little bit slower. But that’s not going to stop you!

So which track is best, Datacamp vs Dataquest?

Don't take my word for it. Please check out both Datacamp and Dataquest's free sections. 

Both do provide some of their initial courses and sections for free. So try them out with the courses below.

Datacamp Data Engineering Track
* https://bit.ly/3i1XqsK

Dataquest.io
https://www.dataquest.io/course/python-fundamentals-de/


Now, I come out more positively for Datacamp, which I also have an affiliate link for. So I will share both below and allow you to pick which one you like best.

I preferred datacamp only because it had a more realistic view of what a data engineer does. I imagine at some point dataquest will have to also create similar courses if it wants to compete. If this occurs, I will happily make a follow-up video rexamining the two.

I8ZkxvgJYxM,Seattle Data Guy,Reviewing Airbnb's Data Engineering Strategy - Why Airbnb Hired More Data Engineers,"Setting up a data strategy is hard.

Having to reimplement a data strategy while your company is still operating is even harder.

But this is exactly what Airbnb did in 2019.

They realized they needed to re-evaluate their data strategy. 

To give a quick snippet from this article, then here is a bit

In early 2019, the company made an unprecedented commitment to data quality and formed a comprehensive plan to address the organizational and technical challenges we were facing around data. Airbnb leadership signed off on the Data Quality initiative — a project of massive scale to rebuild the data warehouse from the ground up using new processes and technology.

x9T2fmuVzk0,Seattle Data Guy,Building ELTs and Data Pipelines Faster With Rivery And SnowflakeDB - Scraping Youtube Data,"There are plenty of clichés about data and its likeness to oil. But it’s far from easy to get value from data.

Companies are creating more data than ever before. At our current pace, 2.5 quintillion bytes of data are created every day. Companies went from pulling data solely from their CRM and ERP systems to pulling data from dozens or hundreds of data sources simultaneously. 

Creating data pipelines for all of these data sources is expensive and difficult to maintain. Data engineers are often stretched thin, between constantly updating API connections, to building new pipelines for every data source. Without access to this data, analysts and data scientists cannot provide key insights for organizational stakeholders. 

But, in the last decade, software solutions have emerged that can pull data from many different data sources without requiring companies to build infrastructure manually. These managed, low-code platforms increase efficiency and time-to-insights, while freeing engineers to work on more important projects.

Some positions require Hadoop, others SQL. Some roles require understanding statistics, while still others require heavy amounts of system design.

4:11 RESOURCES TO PREP FOR YOUR INTERVIEW
12:16 Tips And Tricks For Preparing For Your Interview

About me:
I  have spent my career focused on all forms of data. I have focused on developing algorithms to detect fraud, reduce patient readmission and redesign insurance provider policy to help reduce the overall cost of healthcare. I have also helped develop analytics for marketing and IT operations in order to optimize limited resources such as employees and budget. I privately consults on data science and engineering problems both solo as well as with a company called Acheron Analytics. I have experience both working hands-on with technical problems as well as helping leadership teams develop strategies to maximize their data.

4Vh6Zj5QLU4,Seattle Data Guy,Machine Learning And MLOps Roadmap - Learning MLOps In 16-20 Week Plan #machinelearning #mlops,"What is MLOps, and more importantly, how can you learn more about it quickly?

I put together a roadmap for MLOps.

MLOps Roadmap - https://bit.ly/3wL2wO4

If you want to learn more about machine learning and you need a course, then check out DataCamps Machine Learning Course

*https://bit.ly/3BeLEml

So What Is MLOps?

A group of Google researchers put out a paper titled Machine Learning: The High-Interest Credit Card of Technical Debt. This paper pointed out a growing problem that many companies might have been ignoring.

Using the framework of technical debt, we note that it is remarkably easy to incur massive ongoing maintenance costs at the system level when applying machine learning. [D. Sculley, Gary Holt, etc]

Another way the researchers put this in a follow-up presentation was that launching a rocket was easy, but ongoing operations afterwards was hard. Back then, the concept of DevOps was still coming into its own, but these engineers and researchers realized that there were many more complications in terms of deploying a machine learning model vs. deploying code.

This is when the popularity of machine learning platforms began to rise. Eventually, many of these platforms adopted the term MLOps to explain the service they were providing.

Back to my story:

Early in my career I started as an analyst working in healthcare but I eventually found myself in the role of data engineer at a FAANG and it's really been a great learning experience. 

Along the way I learned how to operate on an engineering team.

How to follow good engineering practices and just in general, develop maintainable systems.

Now that companies are starting to hire even more rapidly for data engineers, I wanted to provide my story for how I went from being a data analyst to data engineer.

From taking the initiative to develop products, to self learning. All of it was required to really challenge myself to be a DE.

3ecKZFBQDJM,Seattle Data Guy,Scaling A Data Team At A BILLION Dollar Start-Up - With Veronica Zhai,"This week I will be interviewing Veronica Zhai and talking about her journey from working as a Trader at JP Morgan to her dive into being a leader in the data analytics space and eventually finding herself as a Principal Product Manager at Fivetran. 

Veronica is currently a principal product manager at the analytics team in Fivetran. She is responsible for the overall analytics roadmap and execution at Fivetran. Over the last 6 months, she helped scale the team from less than 10 people to almost 20. Prior to joining Fivetran, she started her career as an option trader and went on to build the first analytics stack at J.P. Morgan. 

Tomorrow we will be discussing her journey as well as asking her how she manages an analytical team successfully and how she is working to scale it with the needs of Fivetran’s business.

dDFX0-4sLrU,Seattle Data Guy,5 Tech Skills You Should Learn In 2021 - From Devops To System Design,"If you're a developer in 2020, then you have probably come across a job description with a cornucopia of technical skill requirements.

For example, let's look at this set of technical skills required from a real job description taken off Indeed.com.

You might need to take a break halfway through reading.

The Job Description
Experience with Jenkins and Terraform managed AWS infrastructure.

Experience with AWS services (ECR, Lambda, SQS, CloudWatch, Route53).

Hands on programming with Elixir, Python and Java.

Comfortable with support tools (Docker, Git, Bash, AWS CLI)

Production experience with ETL and asynchronous pipelines.

Experience with relational (Postgres/RDS) and nosql (DynamoDB) databases.

Demonstrated ability to actively participate in the design of complex systems.

Production network operations familiarity a plus.

Understanding of ML principles and NLP experience, Kaggle competitions a plus.

Experience with data science libraries (Scikit, NLTK, Gensim, TensorFlow, Keras).

Do You Have All Those Skills?
So apparently this job is looking for a software engineer, data engineer, machine learning engineer, and DevOps engineer all in one.

In some ways, that is a little ridiculous.

Do software engineers really need all these skills these days?

Honestly, yeah, kind of.

But, also...kind of no.

But one other skill that wasn't mentioned was data engineering. If you're interested in learning more about data engineering, then check out the resources below.

Whether they are analysts who want to switch roles into data engineering or CS students who are looking at big data as a career.

There are lots of valid reasons why you should look towards certification programs like the Google Cloud Data Engineering certificate.

I spent the last month going through the certification and have plenty of thoughts.

I think the overall program covers a lot of core concepts for data engineers.

They cover a lot of key concepts.

However, I do think you will need to round out what they cover with some of the resources below:

Back to my story:

Early in my career I started as an analyst working in healthcare but I eventually found myself in the role of data engineer at a FAANG and it's really been a great learning experience. 

Along the way I learned how to operate on an engineering team.

How to follow good engineering practices and just in general, develop maintainable systems.

Now that companies are starting to hire even more rapidly for data engineers, I wanted to provide my story for how I went from being a data analyst to data engineer.

From taking the initiative to develop products, to self learning. All of it was required to really challenge myself to be a DE.

wnrP-4xU4yQ,Seattle Data Guy,How Airbyte Raised 26 Million Dollars For Their Data Engineering Start-Up /W The Co-Founders,"If you're a data engineer you have probably had to create some form of data connector just to get data from point A to point B.

This often requires you develop another snippet of code to connect to another API.

In turn your team is then responsible in terms of maintaining and updating that connector whenever an analyst or data scientist needs new information or the API changes.

This is time consuming and often repetitive.

Enter Airbyte, an early-stage startup that is building an open-source data integration platform to help solve that problem. 

Today the company announced a $26 million Series A, just a couple of months after announcing its $5.2 million seed round.

dyfQoklmjAk,Seattle Data Guy,The Last Advanced SQL Tutorial You Will Ever Need To Watch As A Data Scientist Or Engineer,"SQL is becoming a common skill requirement  across industries.

Companies like Amazon and Google often will require their data analysts, data scientists and product managers to at least be familiar with SQL. This is because SQL remains the language of data. So, in order to be data driven, people need to know how to access and analyze data.

With so many people looking at, slicing, manipulating and analyzing data with SQL we wanted to create the last advanced SQL tutorial you will ever need.

This is the start of a larger series where we will be working on helping you create a SQL project.

Whether you are a data engineer or data analyst this will be a great series for you to work on your sql portfolio.

If you want to learn SQL, consider taking a udemy course.

You can rest assured that the influx of data engineering will not regress anytime soon. To bolster this supposition, the International Data Group (IDG) predicts that the five year compound growth rate (CAGR) of data utilization from 2021 to 2024 will outweigh the total data creation spanning the entirety of the last thirty years. Yes, you heard that correctly, thirty years, dating back far before the origins of both FaceBook, YouTube and Amazon.

We have established that data engineering is a well-paying position, in one of the fastest-growing tech fields, with relatively low competition. What is not to love?

It really shouldn't be about time at a company but skill.

However, skill isn't just technical. Yes, as you become more senior you should play a larger role in making design decisions. However, it is how you communicate and own those design decisions that can also make a huge impact.

There are a number of soft skills developers should emphasize which all have the potential to exponentially increase the impact.

Code review etiquette, saying no to avoid scope creep or better manage resources, communicating, simplifying complex concepts and leadership in general.

All of these skills are very different from what our focus on.

But being a senior engineer, doesn't just mean you are the best programmer.

Two of these popular workflow tools are Luigi by Spotify and Airflow by Airbnb. Both of these workflow engines have been developed to help in the design and execution of computationally heavy workflows that are used for data analysis.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgSHaOvNodA&t=5s

What Is a DAG?

Now before comparing Airflow to Luigi, it’s important we understand an important concept both libraries have in common. Both, essentially, build what is known as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). A DAG is a collection of tasks that run in a specific order with dependencies on previous tasks.

For example, if we had three tasks named Foo, Bar, and FooBar, it might be the case that Foo runs first and Bar and FooBar depend on Foo finishing.

This would create a basic graph like the one below. As you can see, there’s a clear path. Now imagine this with tens of hundreds of tasks.

Large data organizations have massive DAGs with dependencies on dependencies. Having clear access to the DAG allows companies to track where things are going wrong and doesn’t allow bad data into their data ecosystems because if something fails, it’ll often force the tasks downstream to wait until their dependencies are complete.

This is where tools like Airflow and Luigi come in handy.","big data, data analytics, tableau, sql, big query, business, smb, data engineer, how to become a data engineer, apache airflow, luigi data, building your first etl, data pipelines, how to manage big data, learn to become a data engineer, data airflow, data engineering, data science, python",38752.0,815.0,0.0,38.0,934.0,hd,false,Friday,2021-05-07,16:40:02

Not to mention all of the different ways companies have decided to implement their solutions.

In this live stream we are going to talk to Nadine Farah of Rockset and ask for her perspective on what a serverless database is and how it is impacting development. 

Nadine Farah is a senior developer advocate at Rockset leading Rockset's developer initiatives. You can find her leading live coding workshops on Twitch with @rocksetcloud or working on some cool projects. Prior to Rockset, she was at Bose working with the Bose AR team.

Before we get started, there’s one tip I’d like to share.

If we just look at data science interview you will notice that there are several types of interviews that companies conduct.

Some data science interviews are very product and metric driven. These interviews focus more on asking product questions like what kind of metrics would you use to show what you should improve in a product. These are often paired with SQL and some Python questions.

The other type of data science interview tends to be a mix of programming and machine learning.

We recommend asking the recruiter if you aren’t sure which type of interview you will be facing. Some companies are very good at keeping interviews consistent, but even then, teams can deviate depending on what they are looking for. Here are some examples of what we have noticed about some companies data science interviews.

Airbnb — Product heavy, metrics diagnostics, metrics creation, A/B testing, tons of behavioral questions and take home material.

Netflix — Product-sense questions, A/B testing, experimental design, metric design

Microsoft — Programming heavy, binary tree traversal, SQL, machine learning

Expedia — Product, programming, SQL, product sense, machine learning questions about SVM, regression and decision tree

0wjngjhmtJA,Seattle Data Guy,Software Engineer Vs. Data Engineer - Is There A Difference?,"Software engineers vs data engineers

What is the difference between a data engineer and a software engineer?

This answer can vary depending on which company and or team you are working on.

In some cases data engineers are more like software engineers that focus on data.

In other cases data engineers are more like BI developers.

This wide range makes it difficult for data engineers as well as companies to really articulate what they want and their skill sets.

Hopefully this video helps discuss some of those differences.

What is a data engineer and should you become one?


The goals of a data engineer are much more big-picture and development focused. Data engineers build automated systems and model data structures to allow data to be efficiently processed.


This means the goal of a data engineer is to create and develop tables and data pipelines to support analytical dashboards and other data customers (like data scientists, analysts, and other engineers). 


It's similar to most engineers. There is a lot of design, assumptions, limitations, and development that occurs to be able to create some sort of final robust system.

In order to dive in further into big data, we need to understand how one can work on it — and that’s where data engineering comes in.

If you want to learn more about data engineering, check out DataCamp's data engineering bootcamp.

* https://bit.ly/3i1XqsK

Now back to the intro:

Simply put, data engineering is all about managing big datasets and extracting information from them efficiently and accurately.
What’s a Data Engineer?

A data engineer is someone who’s responsible for maintaining and building the architecture of data in a DS project.

Some of the main roles and responsibilities of a data engineer include having to ensure an uninterrupted flow of data between server and application, integrating new data management software, improving data foundational processes, and building data pipelines.

The truth is there are lots of various technologies and concepts that data engineers need to take on — working with cloud computing, ETLs, data warehouses, and so much more.

The requirement of data engineers is constantly expanding, and thus we constantly need to continue learning what is changing in the technology world.

In this video, we’ll talk about the top courses you can take to understand how data engineering works.

LgSHaOvNodA,Seattle Data Guy,What Skills Do Data Engineers Need To Know,"At a high level, data engineers help take data from point A to point B and remodel it into a format where analysts and data scientists can easily use it.

From a skills perspective, this means that data engineers specialize in ETLs (extract, transform, load), automation (usually with Python or other programming languages), data modeling/data warehousing, SQL and NoSQL data manipulation, and data visualization, to name a few.

The skills that are less known are skills like ETLs and data warehousing. Both of these are usually discussed more in master’s or certificate programs after getting your bachelor’s degree — although we suspect this will or has already changed.

More than likely you will need to learn these skills in some form of order.

In fact, Mckinsey just came out with a study that found that the companies they survey could attribute 20% of their bottom line to AI implementations. All those trendy and hyped up words are proving to be effective for companies of all sizes.

As data consultants, we have had the opportunity to help multiple clients in industries like healthcare, insurance, and transportation realize similar gains and cost savings. All of which started with us helping them determine what was the best data strategy for them.

In this video, we wanted to take you through a few of the steps we walk clients through to help them figure out their future data strategy. We hope this article can help you take into consideration what your goals are and perhaps how data can help you achieve those goals in 2021.

Jw4Or_FiT7k,Seattle Data Guy,What Are ETLs And Why We Use Them - For Data Scientists And Data Engineers,"The rise in self-service analytics is a significant selling point for data warehousing, automatic data integrations, and drag and drop dashboards. In fact, in 2020, the largest software IPO this year was a data warehousing company called Snowflake.

The question is how do you get your data from external application data sources into a data warehouse like Snowflake?

The answer is ETLs and ELTs.

ETLs (Extract, Transform, Load) are far from new but they remain a vital aspect of Business Intelligence (BI). With ETLs, data from different sources can be grouped into a single place for analytics programs to act on and realize key business insights.

ELTs have the same exact steps referenced by ETLs except in a slightly different order. In particular, the major difference lies in when the transform step occurs. We will discuss in depth what the T stands for shortly. 

However, to talk about it abstractly, it references business logic, data pivoting and transformations that often take a lot of time and resources to maintain.

In addition to covering what the E, L, and T stand for, this article will also cover the ETL process and various tools.

NPSQN9cRL3s,Seattle Data Guy,Preparing For A Data Engineering Interview: How To Design A Data Warehouse For.A Food Delivery App,"Data warehouses (in all their forms and iterations) have become the backbone of almost every organizations analytics, data science and BI departments.

Over the years they have evolved and taken on new shapes as modern infrastructure has been developed to better manage analytical queries and workloads.

In our last few articles and videos we discussed why data warehouses are used as well as a high level for what they are used for.

Now we wanted to provide more depth to a data warehouse.

Beyond just talking about the high level reasons why you might want to incorporate a data warehouse into your infrastructure. We wanted to discuss the key design components.

A common interview question for data engineers and BI developers is to develop a data warehouse. Personally, I have been asked to design a parking lot data warehouse, a college courses data warehouse and several others for interviews.

I suggest that most people watch a few videos on the topic of data modeling as well as read up on Kimball’s data warehouse design book. After that, then you should think about a few workflows you might enjoy and practice modeling them.

For example, let’s walk through designing a data warehouse for a food delivery app.
How would you approach this design?

Generally, a good way to start is to list out the entities you would consider being part of a food delivery app.

For example here is a list:
* Menu Items(And possibly add-ons)
* Restaurants
* Drop Off Locations 
* Cars
* Persons(Customers and drivers, since a driver in the future might be a customer and visa versa)
* Orders

This would be a good high level set of entities to start with. Especially in an interview. You don’t want to focus on every possible issue and detail. 

I would list these out and prod the interviewer to see if this is all the entities they were concerned with. Often times interviewers have a specific set of questions they want to ask. So if you don’t include all the entities, they may ask about different parts of the workflow you might have forgotten.
From here, the dimensions it may be obvious. You have menu items, restaurants, drop off locations, cars and persons.

These are all dimensional items because they represent entities that don’t change often, don’t contain measurable data and can be used to pivot and break down your future reports.

VjlzuUzYJYM,Seattle Data Guy,What Is A Data Warehouse And Why Do We Build Them?,"We recently had a medium sized company ask us why they might want to build a data warehouse.

They had an operational relational database and a few ideas for products that we found brilliant. We saw clear ways that customers would benefit. However, we did have to take a moment to explain the value of a data warehouse.

Considering their data was small (under 500 GB). A data warehouse seemed like an appropriate fit for their uses cases they explained. As stated above, they had several products they wanted to develop to help better target customers and gain a competitive advantage.

Although most of our posts and projects are data science focused. Our projects often require us to be more than just analysts and data scientists. We also have to be data engineers and designers of data systems.

So here are some great reasons to invest in a data warehouse or other form of centralized data system that analysts and products can utilize.
But this brings up a great question.

What in the world is a data warehouse.

Honestly, many computer science and information system students won’t ever get taught what a data warehouse is.

Yet, almost every large corporation has multiple data warehouses.

We will discuss what a data warehouse is here.","big data, data analytics, tableau, sql, big query, business, data warehousing, bi, data engineering, etls, salesforce, databases, mysql, redshift, snowflake",6330.0,179.0,0.0,22.0,641.0,hd,false,Friday,2020-09-25,06:54:04
ZalsNP6bMFg,Seattle Data Guy,Connecting To Big Query Using Jupyter Notebook On SaturnCloud Part 1,"Using cloud tools like Bigquery and SaturnCloud.io make data scientists, data engineers and analysts work much easier.

Both tools remove the need to manage as much infrastructure on your companies side and instead you can use AWS, Google cloud and Azure to run your analysis and manage your data only when needed.

Today we wanted to use discuss using these cloud tools that are available to everyone to analyze a medical data set. 

In particular will be using the Kaggle data set for medicare providers. This has information on diagnosis related groups average costs, hospital locations and interesting facts about providers and their service quality.

These data sets provide you the ability to answer questions about which states have the highest quality of service (based on the metrics they provide), the highest average costs as well as look into demographics of the patient bases. 

Since healthcare costs tend to be one of the largest focuses, we are going to look at which states have the largest percentage of costs that are above average. We will be using Saturn.io as a platform for our Jupyter notebook and BigQuery in order to query the data.

Tools We Will Use

Saturn.io
For those unfamiliar with tools like Saturn. Saturn.io allows you to easily spin up a VM that has already has Jupyter notebook installed. But it is really much more than just that.

Using Saturn.io makes it easy to share your work with other teammates without having to deal with the hassle of making sure they have all the correct libraries installed. Also, for those of you who have had the issue of running Jupyter Notebooks locally and run out of memory, it also allows you to spin up VMs with the memory and Ram required and only pay for what you use.

There are also a few other bells and whistles that really mitigate some of the complexities of work typically done from a DevOps perspective. That’s what makes tools like this great. In many ways, until you work in a corporate environment where even sharing a basic Excel document can become cumbersome, it is almost hard to explain to younger data scientists why this is so great!

Big Query
Due to where the data is being stored. We will also need to interact with Big Query. This is a Google Cloud service that allows you to query data. In this case, the medicare data is open to everyone but is stored on Google Cloud. 

As like most cloud services, this makes it convenient to manage as long as Google keeps this data public. It is really easy to pull the data and run queries without having to download a csv and load it into your own database.
Connecting to Big Query

For step one we will be retrieving the cms_medicare public data set. In order to do so you will need to set up Google API credentials (see instructions here). You will notice that the credentials don’t so much require an API key as much as the .json file that has the key as seen below.

from google.cloud import bigquery
from google.oauth2 import service_account
credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(
   filename=""JSON_KEYPATH""

)
client = bigquery.Client(
   credentials=credentials,
   project=credentials.project_id,
)
medicare = client.dataset('cms_medicare', project='bigquery-public-data')
Once you have set up your credentials you can then create a reference to a client. This will be your access point.

To get an understanding about what you are working with, you can actually print the list of tables in the cms_medicare data set. Using the code below you can iterate through the tables so you know what you are working with.

We will continue analyzing this data using SQL and python in our next video. Please let us know if you have any questions. Also check out the links below to learn more!

xc9C6xSX8xM,Seattle Data Guy,Connecting To SQL Server With Python - Creating A Database Object,"You will often need to connect to various databases when developing in any language.

In this video we will be discussing how to connect a python script to SQL Server. We will be doing this by creating a python class that is called Databasemanager.

This will allow us to create a one stop shop for running select and insert statements while also logging output. 

Instead of simply creating new connections every time and duplicating code such as logging.info over and over again all over your code. Using this class encapsulates alot of the steps you should be taking when connecting to SQL server.

However, after creating this I did realize I should have added some more try except blocks around attempting to connect. But I think this gets to the point. Please let me know what you think!

mo-FU0mGNx4,Seattle Data Guy,Loading JSON data Using Python - MeetUp API Data,"Once you have pulled data from an API like the Meetup API you will need to load it into a database to make it easier to analyze.

We have pulled the data into JSON and are loading it into the MySQL db. This video focuses mostly on how to load data in MySQL and less on design. If your goal is OOP, then this is not the video for you.

This video is just free flowing code and creating a python script that can load data from the MeetUp api on groups into MySQL. You can use this video as a primer for how you could start to set up an automated scraper that pulls from Meetup.

Due to the fact that I mostly programming on the fly there are some points that I skipped through to save you the hassle of watch me debug any minor issues. 


Once you have done that, you are pretty much set to go using the Meetup API. There is actually a python library for Meetup that you can pip install and then use import meetup.api. There are some benefits, but I think it is so easy to set up your own base scraper class that why limit your control.

Good luck on your data pulls!

OnzBuzRX3FE,Seattle Data Guy,Automating File Loading Into SQL Server With Python And SQL - Part 1,"Loading files into databases are not exactly exciting work. It can be tedious and boring work. Often times it is constrained by tools like SSIS that freak out when a small change is made.
This is one of the core roles of BI and data engineering teams. They need to load files from operational databases into data warehouses. They do this by developing pipelines that process and transform data.
One problem we see is teams have multiple file types, data spec versions, and data providers. Each of which requires a different pipeline just to load into their raw database.
This forces teams to manage 10, 20 maybe even 50 smaller pipelines that are all subject to the change of the data providers. In addition, each new data provider requires an entirely new pipeline to be developed. It also requires managing infrastructure around each pipeline in order to log and track data pipelines statuses. This can quickly become very difficult to manage and tedious to build.

sLhInuwdwcc,Seattle Data Guy,SQL Best Practices - Designing An ETL - Part 1,"Data engineering has many facets. One of the most common projects a data engineer takes on is developing an ETL pipeline from an operational DB to a data warehouse. Our team wanted to cover the overarching design of an ETL.

What are the typical principal components, stages, considerations, etc?
We started this by first writing Creating An ETL Part 1(more to come)

 and we and now have worked on a video that is below that walks through the process. We wanted to discuss why each stage is important and what occurs when data goes from raw to stage, why do we need a raw database and so on.

Data engineering is a complex discipline that partners automation, programming, system design, databases, and analytics in order to ensure that analysts, data scientists and end-users have access to clean data.

This all starts with the basic ETL design.

We are practicing up for a webinar that we will be hosting on ETL development with Python and SQL. The webinar itself will be much more technical and dive much deeper into each component described in the video. However, we wanted to see how using the whiteboard was like in case we need it.

1NCVy8Tylx0,Seattle Data Guy,What Are Confounding Variables and How Do You Standardize Populations?,"A variable that is not considered but plays a role in the outcome of an event is considered a confounding factor. 

In epidemiology, a confounding variable refers to a variable that is a risk factor for a disease or is associated to the exposure of the disease but is not the actual exposure. Confounding variables are not limited to a disease. When developing algorithms for product recommendations, A/B testing or market segmentation confounding variables can creep in. 
 
This can lead to invalid conclusions and incorrect comparisons. When developing algorithms and researching correlations it is important to attempt to parse out as many of these variables as possible. 

Sometimes this means breaking down populations into categories and other times it involves standardizing populations to more fairly depict the data patterns associated in different populations.

This video will demonstrate how to standardize those populations.","math, epidemiology, statistics, analytics, algorithms, correlations, data, healthcare, health",2549.0,19.0,0.0,4.0,674.0,hd,false,Tuesday,2018-05-29,05:15:48
KgHtG0OI1fg,Seattle Data Guy,Introduction To Time Series In R: Measuring Predictive Model Quality,"When developing predictive models and algorithms, whether linear regression or ARIMA models it is important to quantify how well the model fits to the future observations. One of the simplest methods of calculating how correct a model is uses the error between the predicted value and the actual value. From there, there are several methodologies that take this difference and further exploit meaning from it. Quantifying the accuracy of an algorithm is an important step to justifying the usage of the algorithm in product.

About me:
I  have spent my career focused on all forms of data. I have focused on developing algorithms to detect fraud, reduce patient readmission and redesign insurance provider policy to help reduce the overall cost of healthcare. I have also helped develop analytics for marketing and IT operations in order to optimize limited resources such as employees and budget. I privately consult on data science and engineering problems both solo as well as with a company called Acheron Analytics. I have experience both working hands-on with technical problems as well as helping leadership teams develop strategies to maximize their data.

JFRYfBmRJaI,Data with Zach,Netflix vs Meta vs Airbnb: Data Engineering cultures,"How is data engineering different between Facebook, Netflix, and Airbnb?

So, I started my big tech data engineering career at Facebook in 2016. I worked there for about 2 years. Then I jumped to Netflix where I worked for about 2 years. I’ve currently been at Airbnb for about a year. 

Working at these companies gave me a taste of a bunch of different flavors of data engineering. They have some similarities and some differences. Let’s dive into it! 

Let’s start with when I worked at Facebook. 
At Facebook, I worked in growth analytics data engineering. There was a strong focus in my role creating metrics that could be used to measure incremental impact of experiments. 

The languages I used: 
- Python
- SQL

The execution engines I used were:
- SparkSQL
- Apache Hive
- Presto/Trino

The storage systems I used were:
- Hadoop

The file formats I used were:
- ORC (optimized row columnar)

The scheduler I used was Dataswarm (https://asiliconvalleyinsider.com/2016/05/01/data-engineering-facebook/), which is Facebook’s internal scheduler very similar in API design to Apache Airflow. 

My role at Facebook had the strongest focus on visualization out of the three companies. I used a mix of Tableau and an internal tool called Unidash (https://medium.com/analytics-and-data/i-hear-facebook-has-data-does-it-have-data-tools-a9f4c4d82ee7)

Data quality checks were generally put in after a data quality error in the data instead of proactively since Facebook really focuses on “moving fast” 

Something unique about Facebook was Presto was often used in ETL code where as at the other companies Presto is strictly used for auditing only and Spark does the heavy lifting. Also every pipeline I wrote at Facebook was SQL-based which is very different from Netflix and Airbnb. 

Next up, Netflix

At Netflix, I worked in platform and security data engineering. I did a mix of creating metrics for experiments and creating master data for the InfoSec teams to use. 

The languages I used were:
- Python
- SQL
- Scala 

The execution engines I used were:
- SparkSQL and Scala Spark
- Presto/Trino (for data audits and analysis)

The storage systems I used were:
- S3
- Apache Druid (for visualization)
- Postgres (for low-latency queries)

The file formats I used were:
- Parquet

The scheduler I used was an internal scheduler called Meson (https://netflixtechblog.com/meson-workflow-orchestration-for-netflix-recommendations-fc932625c1d9)  which took in a YAML file to generate the pipeline DAG. I prefer Python APIs for schedulers over YAML-based APIs. 

Proactive data quality was pushed heavily at Netflix. They really like the write-audit-publish pattern and want you to have all your ETLs use it. 

I did very light visualization work at Netflix. They have analytics engineers and viz specialists there who focus more deeply on it. 

Netflix also focused on unit and integration testing of ETLs, which Airbnb also does but Facebook did not since Facebook is so SQL-focused. 

Something unique about Netflix is there was a good mix of PySpark and Scala Spark due to their “freedom and responsibility” culture which allowed for more variations in ETLs.  



Next up, Airbnb

At Airbnb, I work in commercial products data engineering. I work mostly on creating high quality master data and leadership since I’m at tech lead at Airbnb. 

The languages I use are:
- Python
- SQL
- Scala 

The execution engines I use are:
- SparkSQL and Scala Spark
- Presto (for data audits and analysis)

The storage systems I use are:
- S3
- Apache Superset (for visualization)
- Postgres (for low-latency queries)

The file formats I used were:
- Parquet

The scheduler I used was of course, Apache Airflow, the popular open source tool created by Airbnb. 

Proactive data quality is pushed heavily at Airbnb. There’s a company wide process called the MIDAS process which is a very thorough process for creating high quality data (https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/data-quality-at-airbnb-870d03080469). We use an internal framework called Wall for our data quality checks (https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/how-airbnb-built-wall-to-prevent-data-bugs-ad1b081d6e8f).",,16558.0,674.0,0.0,71.0,533.0,hd,false,Friday,2022-02-11,01:57:47

Data Velocity - streaming pipelines will become more common over the next 5 years. Learning things like Scala and Apache Flink (https://flink.apache.org/) will make it so data engineers can be ahead of the game here. 

Data Quality - machine learning is only as good as the data you feed into it. Data engineers who are skilled at creating these checks will be in high demand. Look into Amazon Deequ (https://github.com/awslabs/deequ) and Great Expectations (https://greatexpectations.io/)

Cloud tools - the cloud platforms like Snowflake and BigQuery will continue to make some aspects of data engineering simpler. Learning how to harness the power of these platforms will definitely help grow your career over the next 5 years. 

Data Privacy - laws like GDPR and CCPA are making data privacy and governance trickier. Data engineers who are aware of these laws and how to implement compliant will continue to be in high demand.",,35950.0,1518.0,0.0,89.0,179.0,hd,false,Saturday,2021-12-25,23:40:41

There are a lot of things to consider as you're building a data model.

Performance, naming, scheduling, etc.

But one thing you cannot overlook is establishing relationships between your tables. 

Otherwise, you don't really have a model - you just have a bunch of disconnected data points.

And a major part of this process is determining the unique identifier in each of your warehouse tables.

It can determine how useful your model becomes and how well it can scale.

So in this video, we're going to talk about a ""key"" topic known as the Surrogate Key. 

We'll talk about:
- What they are
- Why they're important
- And why you might want to consider using them for your own modeling, if you haven't already

In data modeling, there's no shortage of opinions.

In fact, you'll likely even have different opinions within the same team.

So I recently created a post in The Modern Data Community with a sample scenario and asked others how they would reply.

If there is such thing as the ""end"" of a data pipeline, it's typically a report.

But if you've ever built one of these reports you know that it's never just a simple handoff.

There's almost always some sort of back and forth.

Or future requests for adjustments.


So what I want to talk about in this video is where you decide to actually make those logic changes.

And the secondary impacts of that decision.


The two common schools of thought here are:
1 - Making changes directly inside the report 
2 - Keeping changes in the database (transformation layer code)


In this video, I want to make a case for why I personally think you're better off going with option 2.

But whether or not you agree with me...

Hopefully it'll encourage you to consider what's best for your team (& company) going forward.

All data teams (large & small) have at least one thing in common.

Source data.

But not everyone handles it the same way in their pipelines.
 

For some, they'll reference raw source tables directly in many queries.

For others, they'll create ad-hoc custom tables to address subtle formatting changes.

But without any real over arching strategy or consistent naming behind it.
 

While a more popular topic is data modeling (ex. kimball, one big table, etc.)

I believe an equally more important area to consider is what you do BEFORE you start creating those core data models.

For many, this ""before"" layer doesn't exist at all.
 

In previous videos I've talked about a 3-Layered Data Model. 

And today I want to focus solely on Layer 1, which addresses this concept.

It's called a ""Staging"" layer.

When done right, it can help you establish reliable pipelines from the very start.

If you're using dbt, at some point you'll need to create a Macro.

If you're not familiar with Macros, essentially they are like ""functions"" in other programming languages.

They're used to create re-usable bits of code and make your project much more dynamic.

It's truly one of the most valuable parts of using dbt.


But the deeper you get into macros, the more you'll also run into Jinja.

And while powerful, Jinja itself has a bit of a learning curve.

In short, Jinja is a templating language that allows you to compile more complex queries.

Think of it like templating a website with reusable components (header, body, footer).

But instead of website parts, we're able to template SQL queries.


Like many things, this can get really complicated.

But if you know how to use a few key functions of Jinja, you'll be able to cover a wide variety of scenarios.


So with that said, in this video I want to walk you through 3 examples of how to use helpful Jinja functions within a custom dbt macro.

Whether you're brand new to Jinja or need a quick refresher, this will be a great working-session style video for you to check out.

You don't need to process every record in a table, every time.

Fortunately, dbt has a great solution for this scenario with their ""incremental"" materialization option.

When setup properly, they can help you significantly cut costs & processing time.

This is because incremental models only process new data vs rebuilding an entire table (the default setting).


But setting up incremental models isn't always straight forward.

It requires a few steps, an understanding of underlying functionality and some customization.

All that to say, I've noticed this process trips people up and therefore they put off implementing it.


So in today's video I'd like to help you out by covering:

All things being equal, I think we'd all want access to source data in real time.

This is the holy-grail of data engineering and removes most delays to insights.

One architecture approach that makes this possible is known as the Kappa Architecture.

It focuses on real-time data loading & processing rather than waiting on batches.

No brainer, right?


Well, back here in the real-world, things aren't made equal. 

Different architecture approaches require different levels of complexity (aka skill requirements).

Which impacts design & maintenance time.

Which all tends to mean higher overall cost of ownership.

All that to say, just because it's technically possible, doesn't always mean it's the best choice for your team.


Truthfully, I find it's usually not necessary.

BUT that doesn't mean you shouldn't be aware of it and be able to evaluate it.

https://www.ModernDataCommunity.com

-----

With dbt Core, you'll likely find yourself developing in a local editor, then copying compiled code into your database server to look at the results.

But as of version 1.5, there's a new command called ""show"" that allows you to run queries (and see results) directly from your terminal.

When would you use this?
- Preview results before deploying (results do not get materialized)
- Investigate a test failure
- Review table records without changing tools/screens

In this video, I want to show you how to use this command so you can be more efficient with your development and avoid this hopping back and forth.

Thank you for watching!

Most data teams have similar players and types of work.

This includes not just people on the core data engineering side, but others that operate around it.

While the specific naming and responsibilities will vary by company, this video will break down some of the most common structures I've seen in my career.

By the end, you'll walk away with a better understanding of common overall layouts to expect, or if you're trying to start your own team, how you can think about getting organized.

In the modern data landscape, it's the tools & technologies that grab all of the headlines.

But a potentially more important decision you need to make is about your data strategy.

While there are many different approaches, today I want to cover one in particular known as ""Modern Data Warehouse"". 

This is the most common approach I've seen and is ideal for most small-mid size companies looking to establish their architecture. 

It's also important to remember that most companies aren't ""big data"" enterprises or require overly complex systems.

Avoid the urge to keep up with big tech companies if you don't feel it applies to you. Which is probably the case.

I'd take simplicity & clarity over complexity any day.

Every year many data teams embark on massive data migration projects.

Typically this involves moving from an outdated stack to a more cloud-based & modern set of tools and processes.

Unfortunately, far too often these exciting projects turn into a huge headache that leave you questioning if it was all worth it.

But it doesn't have to be that way.

So in today's video I want to share a few of the common ways I've seen things go wrong and share some thoughts on ways you can avoid it.

As you build out your dbt project, you're inevitably going to run into the concept of environments.

But one thing that I hear from clients as well as other engineers is that it can be a bit confusing configuring environments on dbt Core, the open source version, compared to how it's done on dbt Cloud.

So in today's video I'm going to break down the differences between 3 key concepts of:
- targets
- environments
- environment variables

By the end, you'll understand the similarities and differences and feel comfortable working with these concepts regardless of which platform or version that you're using.

Without a solid data modeling approach, most architectures fall apart.

And in a previous video I broke down five of the most common data modeling strategies you'll see in a modern stack.

But today we'll look at little deeper into three of the most common examples which include:
1. Normalized
2. Star schema 
3. Data Vault 

But rather than going deep into code, instead we'll review some images (that I found in a simple Google search) of what some example table/relationship designs can look like in each approach.

My hope is by giving this level of example will help get the point across a little better and clear up any gaps that you may be having after watching the last video.

One of the most fun aspects of being a data engineer is creating different automations.

And in particular, one area that's really important is CI/CD , which stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment. 

This is where you can automate your testing and release strategy.

But I also understand that this concept can be a little vague or unclear if you haven't seen it in action.

So in today's video I'll show you a real-life example of how to use Github to make this happen.

This is just one example of why people really like code-based tools because of the ability to automate and do things like this.

This can be applied not only to your deployments but as we'll mostly cover in this video the idea of automating your data quality checks.

When working on a data team, it's one thing to build the code, it's another to plan and strategize your deployment approach. 

And over the years I've worked on a handful of different teams where the strategies have been different, whether it's because of personal preference or the technology chosen.

So in this video, I've compiled three of the most common approaches that I've seen to help you understand common strategies teams are taking.

This video will be based off of a dbt (data-build-tool) project, which is a data transformation tool.

Some data points naturally change over time, but it happens slowly.

Unsurprisingly, this is referred to as a ""slowly changing dimension"" or SCD.

This is a common data modeling scenario but can take a while to get right.

But if you use dbt, you can take advantage of their built-in Snapshots feature.

Snapshots require just a few configurations to set up and the result is a new table that tracks historical changes just like a SCD.

So in this video, you'll learn more about what dbt Snapshots are and how to easily add them to your project.

Before you can do anything cool with data you need to store it somewhere.

Cloud data storage doesn’t get the same press as the other components of a data stack but is a vital part of any platform.

But it doesn’t stop there.

Did you know there are actually multiple ways (or temperatures) for how to store data on the cloud?

In today’s video we’ll review the importance of data storage, the 3 temperatures and wrap up with some advice for how you should choose what’s best for you.

https://www.ModernDataCommunity.com

-----

No developer actually enjoys creating documentation.

We want to build things, not be part-time writers.

But we also all have our own opinions and egos when it comes to best practices.

We’ve all seen it happen at least once (or much more) in our career.

A few members on the team get into an extended debate about how something should be done, or be written.

I’m as guilty as anybody in this.

And, sure, major decisions warrant this type of discussion.
 
But constantly debating like this on minor decisions can become incredibly counterproductive.

One of the best pieces of documentation you can create to avoid this is a simple style guide.

This will help the team decide, and document, how things should be done.

It can then be referenced to answer minor formatting questions without needing to ask others.

So today I want to help you with this by sharing 3 of the most important things to include.

This will be focused primarily on SQL, but can be applied to any language.

Let’s dive in.

The last thing you want as a dbt developer is to deploy a breaking change. 

Not only will it look like you’re not paying attention...

But will also frustrate those who rely on  those models.

Fortunately, dbt was built for integration.

Which allows you to be creative and get ahead of this issue.

And speaking of model dependencies, one area in particular where this problem can be felt is within Reverse ETL processes. 

So in today’s video I want to show you a cool feature within Census, a leading Reverse ETL platform, that will not only help keep your models in sync...

But also, more importantly, allow you to add an automated check directly to GitHub.

in this video I want to share some of the most commonly used ones across the modern stack.

Use the tools mentioned in this video to guide your learning.

Figure out what you want to learn next and overall become more aware of what's out there. 

**Important Note**
We'll be going through a lot of tools in this video. I want you to know that you don't need to learn how to use every single platformed mentioned to be a great data engineer. 

I personally have not used all of them in depth and I've never met anybody who is an expert at them all either. 

Ultimately the goal is to give you a perspective of the overall data landscape and help guide your journey to becoming a great engineer.  Pick out one tool you don't know today and start learning it. Once you master that, move on to another.

This might be the first time you’ve ever seen the term “Reverse ETL”

But if you’ve ever been told your report numbers don’t look right 

Or asked to manually upload a CSV...

Then I think you’ll quickly see the value of this concept.

In this video I want to help you better understand the power of this concept by breaking down:
1. How we got here
2. Discussing why it’s so helpful
3. Sharing some common use cases.

All developers share a common insecurity...

And it's whether or not we have enough of the right skills or if we’re falling behind.

It doesn't matter if you’re brand new to data engineering or a seasoned vet.

There’s always something new to learn.

In today’s video I want to break down some of the specific skills to know as a data engineer.

So that you can identify what you need to learn to land your first job or maybe some things to take that next step in your career.

When you think about a data team, what comes to mind?

Maybe you think about a single group of developers along with some QA support.

But the truth is, today the lines of what consists of a data team are becoming more blurred.

Modern data engineering has evolved into a much more continuous and collaborative endeavor spanning across multiple teams.

Data is now often viewed as a product just like you might think about a software application.

And because of this shift, new approaches for building and releasing data products have evolved as well.

A term often used to describe this new workflow is “data ops” 

And in today’s video I’m going to break down three of the biggest trends in this world of data ops to help you feel more aware and confident working in this new way.

When we think about interacting with our computers, the first thing that comes to mind is usually opening different applications and clicking through folders.

But when it comes to executing certain tasks, doing things this way is actually NOT the most efficient way to get it done.

And that’s where the almighty command line and languages like Bash come into play.

And while you don’t need to be a hacking wizard with the terminal, it is important as a data engineer to have a general working knowledge and be able to run some of the basic commands. 

So in this video I want to give you a brief overview of bash, talk about examples of where you’ll run into it and finally provide 5 simple commands to get started.

If you want a simple way to stand out as a great developer, find a way to make something run faster.

And when it comes to SQL, a great way to accomplish this is by properly using indexes.

All modern data engineers NEED to be able to work with YAML/YML.

But why is it so important?

YAML has quickly become to go-to file type for configuration files.

And pretty much every modern tool requires configuration of some sort. 

This includes things like automation, scheduling, deployments and much more.

It provides many similar features as traditional markdown files like XML and JSON…

But in a more readable way.

A common data type you'll see in a modern stack is JSON.

This is often used for data streams, software applications, etc. 

The tricky part as an engineer is trying to combine it with structured, relational data. 

Fortunately, most modern databases now have ways to store this data type.

Add in the dynamic features of dbt and you can really simplify this task.

In this video we will first look at how to flatten data in snowflake...

Then use the dbt features of jinja and macros to create a reusable component in our project.

Data factory is one of the best at combining the user-friendliness of a drag and drop tool w/ the versioning and automation of a code based tool.

One of the best features of data factory is the ability to connect directly to the get provider of your choice.

In this video we will see how this process actually works in Data Factory.
More about Source Control on Data Factory:
By default, the Azure Data Factory user interface experience (UX) authors directly against the data factory service. This experience has the following limitations:

- The Data Factory service doesn't include a repository for storing the JSON entities for your changes. The only way to save changes is via the Publish All button and all changes are published directly to the data factory service.
- The Data Factory service isn't optimized for collaboration and version control.
- The Azure Resource Manager template required to deploy Data Factory itself is not included.

To provide a better authoring experience, Azure Data Factory allows you to configure a Git repository with either Azure Repos or GitHub. Git is a version control system that allows for easier change tracking and collaboration.

Any project you build is designed to be released at some point. While that may seem obvious, there are some specific steps required to actually make this happen.

In this video, we will walk through what releases are, how they work and how to easily create one in GitHub.

What are Releases?
Releases are deployable software iterations you can package and make available for a wider audience to download and use.

Releases are based on Git tags, which mark a specific point in your repository's history. A tag date may be different than a release date since they can be created at different times. 

You can receive notifications when new releases are published in a repository without receiving notifications about other updates to the repository. 

Anyone with read access to a repository can view and compare releases, but only people with write permissions to a repository can manage releases. You can manually create release notes while managing a release.

Alternatively, you can automatically generate release notes from a default template, or customize your own release notes template.

Data storage is a crucial part of any modern data architecture. 

You'll likely need a landing zone to hold all of your source system data in its raw form.

From massive streams of unstructured data to a handful of standard files, Azure has you covered.

In this video, we will walk through two of the most common storage options: BLOB and File.

-------

## What is Azure Blob Storage? 
Azure Blob Storage is an object storage solution for the cloud. Blob Storage allows you to store a massive amount of unstructured data. The unstructured data need not be of the specific data model.

## What is Azure File Storage?
Azure Files offer fully managed File shares in the cloud that are accessible via the industry-standard SMB. Azure File shares can be mounted concurrently by cloud or on-premises deployments of Windows, Linux, and macOS. It can be cached on Windows servers with Azure File Sync for faster access.

The ability to quickly create resources on Azure is a gift and a curse.

While it's so simple, the downside is that things can quickly get out of hand.

Soon you have all of these resources but no strategy or organization.

The best way to manage this is w/ Resource Groups and Subscriptions. 

In this video we'll walk through these concepts and demo how to actually create a RG.

Enjoy!

About Resource Groups:

Organizing your cloud-based resources is critical to securing, managing, and tracking the costs related to your workloads. To organize your resources, define a management group hierarchy, follow a well-considered naming convention and apply resource tagging.

You can use them to group related resources for an application and divide them into groups for production and non-production, or any other organizational structure you prefer.

Your users probably know best. 

Why not give them the ability to ask questions in their own words?

I've now seen this same type of feature pop up in various different data viz tools.

For this to work to its potential, it is critical that the underlying data looks good.

Have you used this before?

How many hours have you spent trying to perfectly match report colors and designs with what your company requires? If you have done it once, you've probably done it a thousand times... but no more!

In this video we will look at Power BI Report Themes and how you can customize them down to the most detailed components. By leveraging report themes, you can create a single file that any developer can use that will ensure they are using the exact same colors, fonts, etc.... every time.

The result? A consistent look and feel for every report.

I know I have personally spent wayyy too much time adjusting colors on reports. In hindsight, I could have definitely simplified this if I was more knowledgeable on this feature.

--

What are report themes in Power BI Desktop?

With Power BI Desktop report themes, you can apply design changes to your entire report, such as using corporate colors, changing icon sets, or applying new default visual formatting.
When you apply a report theme, all visuals in your report use the colors and formatting from your selected theme as their defaults.

Most workflow will be comprised of multiple jobs and you'll need to update some configurations if any are dependent on another.

In this video, we will look at how to add a new job and make sure it is only runs AFTER another job as successfully completed. In addition, we will look at how to work around errors if a pre-requisite job happens to fail. 

Some syntax items we will cover:
needs:
Identifies any jobs that must complete successfully before this job will run. It can be a string or array of strings. If a job fails, all jobs that need it are skipped unless the jobs use a conditional expression that causes the job to continue.

always():
Causes the step to always execute, and returns true, even when canceled. A job or step will not run when a critical failure prevents the task from running. For example, if getting sources failed.

Whether for QA or for other purposes, at times you may want to quickly create random data comprised of various data types. Snowflake offers some built-in functions to make this process very easy and scalable. 

In this video, we will walk through some of the most common data generation functions so that you can become more comfortable using them as needed.

Data Generation functions allow you to generate data. Snowflake supports two types of data generation functions:

- Random, which can be useful for testing purposes.
These functions produce a random value each time. Each value is independent of the other values generated by other calls to the function. The underlying algorithm produces pseudo-random values, and thus the values are not truly random or independent, but without knowing the algorithm, the values are essentially unpredictable, usually evenly distributed (if the sample size is large), and pseudo-independent of each other.

- Controlled distribution, which can be useful for providing unique ID numbers for records that do not already have unique identifiers.
These functions produce values that are not independent. For example, the NORMAL function returns values that have an approximately “normal” (bell-shaped) distribution based on a specified mean and standard deviation. Thus, each new value generated is at least indirectly influenced by previously generated values as the function tries to maintain the specified distribution. As another example, the SEQ family of functions return a sequence of values.

Gists are similar to your normal GitHub repositories, but primarily focused on scenaios where you only have one (or a few files) as opposed to a full project with many directories, etc.. This can be really useful for scenarios where you have some pieces of code that you want to share with colleagues, friends or the general public without buildling out a full on project.

Every gist is a Git repository, which means that it can be forked and cloned. If you are signed in to GitHub when you create a gist, the gist will be associated with your account and you will see it in your list of gists when you navigate to your gist home page.

Gists can be public or secret. Public gists show up in Discover, where people can browse new gists as they're created. They're also searchable, so you can use them if you'd like other people to find and see your work.

In this video we will look at how to create a gist, clone it locally and finally make changes.

Did you know you can run queries against your Snowflake environment through SQL Server?

This is made possible by ODBC (Open Database Connectivity), which is a standard application programming interface for accessing database management systems.

By leveraging this standard, along with SQL Server's feature of creating a Linked Server, you can run commands against your Snowflake environment directly through SSMS.

Why would you do this?
- You have data stored in both places and do not want to copy data across servers (duplicates data)
- You are in the middle of a migration and still need access to both systems
- Just for fun

The best part of this setup is that it allows you to take advantage of all of the storage/computational benefits of Snowflake because the queries themselves are running on the Snowflake environment, not SQL Server.

If you are planning on working with GitHub, you need to understand branches. In this video, we will review the process of creating a new branch, adding a new file, committing the new change and then finally pushing the branch to out GitHub repository.

Branches allow you to develop features, fix bugs, or safely experiment with new ideas in a contained area of your repository.

Use a branch to isolate development work without affecting other branches in the repository. Each repository has one default branch, and can have multiple other branches. You can merge a branch into another branch using a pull request.

Learn how to leverage Drill Through Filters to make your report more dynamic.

With drill through in Power BI reports, you can create a page in your report that focuses on a specific entity such as a supplier, customer, or manufacturer. When your report readers use drill through, they right-click a data point in other report pages, and drill through to the focused page to get details that are filtered to that context. You can also create a button that drills through to details when they click it.

You can set up drill through in your reports in Power BI Desktop or the Power BI service.

A freshness block is used to define the acceptable amount of time between the most recent record, and now, for a table to be considered ""fresh"".

This is useful to help automatically keep tabs on how up to date your sources are so that you can be sure you are creating your data models on the most accurate data. It can also be useful to make sure you are on track for certain SLAs (if you have them). 

This video will walk you through the syntax of the freshness block and how it works under the hood.

-----

Sometimes your documentation becomes a bit complex to the point where it would be better to write it outside of your YML file. Or perhaps you find you are re-writing the same definition multiple times. In these scenarios (among others), using a docs block can be helpful. In this video I will walk through how to add them to your project.

To declare a docs block, use the jinja docs tag. Docs blocks must be uniquely named, and can contain arbitrary markdown. In practice, a docs block might look like this:

Docs blocks should be placed in files with a .md file extension. By default, dbt will search in all resource paths for docs blocks (i.e. the combined list of source-paths, data-paths, analysis-paths, macro-paths and snapshot-paths) — you can adjust this behavior using the docs-paths config.

To use a docs block, reference it from your schema.yml file with the doc() function.

https://www.ModernDataCommunity.com

-----

The Fuzzy Lookup transformation performs data cleaning tasks such as standardizing data, correcting data, and providing missing values.

The Fuzzy Lookup transformation differs from the Lookup transformation in its use of fuzzy matching. The Lookup transformation uses an equi-join to locate matching records in the reference table. It returns records with at least one matching record, and returns records with no matching records. In contrast, the Fuzzy Lookup transformation uses fuzzy matching to return one or more close matches in the reference 
table.

---

The Fuzzy Grouping transformation performs data cleaning tasks by identifying rows of data that are likely to be duplicates and selecting a canonical row of data to use in standardizing the data.

The Fuzzy Grouping transformation requires a connection to an instance of SQL Server to create the temporary SQL Server tables that the transformation algorithm requires to do its work. The connection must resolve to a user who has permission to create tables in the database.

A named external stage is a database object created in a schema. This object stores the URL to files in cloud storage, the settings used to access the cloud storage account, and convenience settings such as the options that describe the format of staged files. 

In this video we walk through the full process of uploading data from cloud storage (ex. Azure) and loading it to a Snowflake table by using a Stage.

**NOTE**:
In this video I indicate there are storage costs associated for holding on to the staged data. However, that would actually not apply for ""External"" stages (such as Azure Blob, S3, etc.). Rather, this type of stage would be acting as a pointer to that cloud location. You would, however, incur storage costs if it is an ""Internal"" stage where Snowflake would actually be holding the data.

Also, purging/removing from an ""External"" stage WILL DELETE the file in the cloud storage as well. This example was meant to show how that syntax works, but be cautious before running that step if it is critical data!

dbt (data build tool) enables analytics engineers to transform data in their warehouses by simply writing select statements. dbt handles turning these select statements into tables and views.

dbt does the T in ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) processes – it doesn’t extract or load data, but it’s extremely good at transforming data that’s already loaded into your warehouse.

Once you've connected two tables together with a relationship, you can work with the data in both tables as if they were a single table, freeing you from having to worry about relationship details, or flattening those tables into a single table before importing them. In many situations,w

Power BI Desktop can automatically create relationships for you. However, if Power BI Desktop can’t determine with a high-degree of certainty that a relationship between two tables should exist, it doesn't automatically create the relationship. In that case, you must do so.

With bookmarks in Power BI Desktop, you capture the currently configured view of a report page, including filtering and the state of visuals. Later, you can go back to that state by selecting the saved bookmark.

You can also create a collection of bookmarks, arrange them in the order you want, and later step through each bookmark in a presentation to highlight a series of insights, or the story you want to tell with your visuals and reports.

There are many uses for bookmarking. For example, you can use bookmarks to keep track of your own progress in creating reports (bookmarks are easy to add, delete, and rename) and you can create bookmarks to build a PowerPoint-like presentation that steps through bookmarks in order, thereby telling a story with your report.

The for_each argument will iterate over a data structure to configure resources or modules with each item in turn.

It works best when the duplicate resources need to be configured differently but share the same lifecycle. 

In this video I will show you how to use this argument by creating a map variable as well as leveraging the to_set expression directly in a  resource.

Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code software tool that can be utilized to manage and automate your cloud infrastructure.

Like many recent open-source projects, this tool has a ton of great features and can make your life easier as you learn more about it.It will allow you to be more explicate in how you manage your resources/permissions and keep you much more organized.

Access control privileges determine who can access and perform operations on specific objects in Snowflake.

I find that Snowflake's way of handling permissions is really quite simple to work with once you get the hang of it. Creating a heiarchy of permissions removes duplicate work and allows you to easily add new roles as needed.

---

Roles are the entities to which privileges on securable objects can be granted and revoked. Roles are assigned to users to allow them to perform actions required for business functions in their organization. A user can be assigned multiple roles. This allows users to switch roles (i.e. choose which role is active in the current Snowflake session) to perform different actions using separate sets of privileges.

Roles can be also granted to other roles, creating a hierarchy of roles. The privileges associated with a role are inherited by any roles above that role in the hierarchy.

dbt provides a mechanism, variables, to provide data to models for compilation. This is functions in a similar fashion as other common programming languages and tools that offer the ability to store data in a variable form.

In this video I will walk through the two ways that dbt allows you to define variables - In the dbt_project.yml file and on the command line.

What is dbt?
dbt (data build tool) enables analytics engineers to transform data in their warehouses by simply writing select statements. dbt handles turning these select statements into tables and views.

dbt does the T in ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) processes – it doesn’t extract or load data, but it’s extremely good at transforming data that’s already loaded into your warehouse.

As somebody coming from the Microsoft world, there are some subtle differences and new features that I feel are helpful to review.

Snowflake is an analytic data warehouse provided as Software-as-a-Service (SaaS). Snowflake provides a data warehouse that is faster, easier to use, and far more flexible than traditional data warehouse offerings.

Snowflake’s data warehouse is not built on an existing database or “big data” software platform such as Hadoop. The Snowflake data warehouse uses a new SQL database engine with a unique architecture designed for the cloud. To the user, Snowflake has many similarities to other enterprise data warehouses, but also has additional functionality and unique capabilities.

Seeds are CSV files in your dbt project (typically in your data directory), that dbt can load into your data warehouse using the dbt seed command.

Seeds can be referenced in downstream models the same way as referencing models — by using the ref function.

Because these CSV files are located in your dbt repository, they are version controlled and code reviewable. Seeds are best suited to static data which changes infrequently.

Learn how to use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to create a new role and policy!

You manage access in AWS by creating policies and attaching them to IAM identities (users, groups of users, or roles) or AWS resources. A policy is an object in AWS that, when associated with an identity or resource, defines their permissions. AWS evaluates these policies when an IAM principal (user or role) makes a request.

Permissions in the policies determine whether the request is allowed or denied. Most policies are stored in AWS as JSON documents. AWS supports six types of policies: identity-based policies, resource-based policies, permissions boundaries, Organizations SCPs, ACLs, and session policies.

Learn how to use Data Migration Service on AWS! In this tutorial, we will go through an example of migrating data from a MySQL database to an S3 bucket using DMS.

AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) is a cloud service that makes it easy to migrate relational databases, data warehouses, NoSQL databases, and other types of data stores. You can use AWS DMS to migrate your data into the AWS Cloud, between on-premises instances (through an AWS Cloud setup), or between combinations of cloud and on-premises setups.

With AWS DMS, you can perform one-time migrations, and you can replicate ongoing changes to keep sources and targets in sync. If you want to change database engines, you can use the AWS Schema Conversion Tool (AWS SCT) to translate your database schema to the new platform. You then use AWS DMS to migrate the data. Because AWS DMS is a part of the AWS Cloud, you get the cost efficiency, speed to market, security, and flexibility that AWS services offer.

FpgkpjSyBOw,Alex The Analyst,State of AI in Analytics | Will AI be the End of Data Analysts?,"A lot of Data Analysts are worried right now about the future of Analytics due to AI. To be honest, it's pretty understandable.

In this video I'm going to talk about everything concerning AI as it pertains to Analytics. The good, the bad, and where I think it will be in 5+ years. 

I understand this is a sensitive topic and not everyone is going to agree with my viewpoint, but hopefully this will open up a discussion around these things where we can dive into it more as a community.

Today we look at some SQL Interview Questions. The first questions we look at are Phone interview questions which are generally more broad questions. Then we look at In-Person interview questions which are typically more technical and specific. 

You may get some technical questions during your interview or none at all! It all depends on the position and the people interviewing. This is by no means an exhaustive list, but are ones that I have personally been asked or I have heard have been asked from other colleagues and redditors.

I hope these really do help you try to see what kind of questions you may be asked and what things you may need to prepare for to be ready for your next interview!

It can be even harder when you're doing it by yourself! I highly recommend working with Recruiters to help you navigate the ever-changing landscape of the job market. They will help you get more phone-interviews and in-person interviews and help coach you through any questions you may have.
